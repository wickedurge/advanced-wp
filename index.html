                <p>I'm a full time Front End developer at <a href="http://push22.com">Push 22</a> who has been working with WordPress for about 4 years.</p>
                <p>I'm not a computer scientist. My background is actually in rhetoric, philosophy, and biology. I learned WordPress through trial and error (mostly error), insane deadlines, and lots of Googling.</p>

                    <h3>Think of WordPress like an automotive factory.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linux and Apache are the foundation.</li>
                        <li>The MySQL database is where the raw materials are kept.</li>
                        <li>CSS is where the paint and styling is applied.</li>
                        <li>PHP is the robots and workers who put all of the parts together before they go to be painted.</li>

                    <p>While PHP can be a bit of a pain at first, it's also a huge time saver.</p>
                    <pre>

&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>&lt;a href="./"> Home &lt;/a>&lt;/li>

                    <h3>Getting ready for WordPress</h3>
                    <p>WordPress/PHP require more special software to make them "go" than plain HTML does. Usually this software is run on a dedicated web server, but today we're going to run it on our computers directly.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Today we're going to use Desktop Server!</h3>

                    <p>If you haven't already:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Visit <a href="https://serverpress.com/">https://serverpress.com/</a>.</li>
                        <li>Scroll down about halfway and click the “Free - add to cart button".</li>
                        <li>Fill in your information on the form (they do require an email address).</li>
                        <li>Agree to the terms and click the purchase button (it’ll be $0.00).</li>
                        <li>You’ll redirect to a new page with a list of download links. Choose the one that matches your computer’s operating system.</li>
                        <li>Download and run the installer program.</li>
                    </ol>

                <section>
                    <h3>Let's get this thing fired up!</h3>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Go ahead and open Desktop Server. It might ask you for your computer's password.</li>
                      <li>Now you want to start Apache and MySQL services.</li>
                      <li>Now start web services. And finally, create a new development website. When it asks where your site root should go, choose a directory that's easy to navigate to. (Desktop is usually good.)</li>
                      <li>Click the WordPress install link when it appears.</li>
                      <li>Fill out the WordPress installation form (super easy).</li>

              <section>

               <h3>Let's start with a simple photo blog site.</h3>
               <p>In your course files, you'll see a folder called <code>basic-html</code>. Open the <code>index.html</code> you find there.</p>

               <h3>We're going to duplicate a site like this in WordPress.</h3>
           </section>

                  <section>
                    <h3>Exercise!</h3>
                    <p>Let's use our first WordPress function!</p>
                    <p>Today we're going to start with one of the most common: <code>wp_nav_menu</code>.</p>
                    <p>Let's start by looking at that function on the WordPress codex.</p>
                    <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/" target="_blank">wp_nav_menu</a>
                </section>

               <section>
                   <h3>First, let's make our menu in the WordPress back-end.</h3>
                   <p>Add three new pages to your WordPress site.</p>
                   <p>Now add a nav menu.</p>
               </section>

               <section>
                   <h3>Add the wp_nav_menu function</h3>
                   <p>Open <code>header.php</code>.</p>
                   <pre>
                       <code class="html">
&lt;?php wp_nav_menu (); ?>
                       </code>
                   </pre>
               </section>


                <section>
                    <h3>Let's break down that function we just used:</h3>
                    <pre>
                       <code>
&lt;?php wp_nav_menu (); ?>
                       </code>

                   </pre>
                    <p>So we're opening PHP, writing in our function, and then closing PHP.</p>
                    <p>What's up with the parantheses?</p>

                    <p>They're where we put in our arguments in the form of an array.</p>
                    <p>Let's go back to the Codex and look at some arguments that are available for this function.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>How do arguments work?</h3>
                    <p>Some arguments behave like filters: you use them to narrow data down to a specific category or type.</p>
                    <p>Other arguments are called booleans. This is computer science nerd for "true or false".</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Let's go back to our wp_nav_menu function and add an argument.</h3>
                    <p>WordPress supports having multiple menus on the site. Let's use an argument to specify a menu called "main".</p>

                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Exercise: using arguments with functions</h3>
                    <p>Let's add another menu, this time only include two of your pages. Be sure to give it a distinctive name.</p>
                </section>

                 <section>
                    <h3>Modifying our existing function</h3>
                    <p>Add a filter that specifies which menu to load.</p>
                </section>

           </section>

                    <h3>Let's explain what just happened...</h3>
                    <p>Time to understand PHP functions!</p>
                    <p>Navigate to your WordPress directory and create a new file called <code>test.php</code>.</p>
                    <p>Paste in this code:</p>
                    <pre>
        <code class="html">
&lt;html>
 &#60;p>I'm just some plain old HTML &#60;/p>
&lt;/html>
        </code>
    </pre>
                    <small>Cool thing about PHP: you can just put regular old HTML in your files and everything is cool. <strong>However, you cannot put PHP in your HTML files!</strong></small>

                    <p>In your browser, go to <code>your-site-name-here.dev/test.php</code>.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>You should see your HTML content.</p>

                    <h3>Congratulations! You've made your first PHP page!</h3>

                    <h3>The WordPress Loop</h3>
                    <p>WordPress has its roots as a blogging platform. The Loop is how WordPress displays posts and other dynamic content.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Let me be the first to say: the WordPress loop can be intimidating.</h3>
                    <p>But don't let it get to you!</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Before we start getting into the loop, let's begin with an analogy:</h3>
                    <p>Next time you're in your shower, look at your shampoo bottle and read the instructions. Some of them say "lather, rinse, repeat".</p>
                    <p>What would happen if someone took that literally?</p>
                    <img src="images/shampoo.jpg" alt="">
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>The Loop is the "lather, rinse, repeat" of WordPress theme building.</h3>
                    <p>WordPress will just keep doing this series of actions until it runs out of shampoo... er, I mean posts to do it to.</p>
                    <small>Fun side note: you can create an infinite loop, which will give you the "white screen of death". Remember what I said about WordPress safety?</small>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Let's start with just a basic loop and break down what's going on: </h3>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="php">
&lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

  &lt;div class="entry">
    &lt;?php the_content(); ?>
  &lt;/div>

&lt;?php endwhile; else : ?>

  &lt;p>&lt;?php _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.' ); ?>&lt;/p>

&lt;?php endif; ?>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <small>I know right?!?</small>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Let's break this down one piece at a time...</h3>
                    <pre>
                <code>
&lt;?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
                </code>
            </pre>
                    <p>This starts the Loop, it's saying "if you have some posts, go get them ready, we're going to do something with them</p>
                </section>



                <section>
                    <h3>Wrapping up the loop...</h3>
                    <pre>
                        <code class="php">
&lt;?php endwhile; else : ?>

  &lt;p>&lt;?php _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.' ); ?>&lt;/p>

&lt;?php endif; ?>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>endwhile</code> tells WordPress that the loop is about to end.</li>
                        <li><code>else</code> tells WordPress what to do if there's no posts.</li>
                        <li><code>endif</code> tells WordPress that the loop is totally done now.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What can we do with the Loop besides display posts?</h3>
                    <p>Well, by filtering posts we can do all sorts of things!</p>
                    <p>The Loop can be used to display a picture gallery, a news section, or any number of things.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Filtering the Loop</h3>
                    <p>Exercise: filtering posts in the loop</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add 2 post categories.</li>
                        <li>Add 4 more posts, two in each category.</li>
